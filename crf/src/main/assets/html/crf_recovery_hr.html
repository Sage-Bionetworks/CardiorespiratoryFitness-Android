    <title>What does my Recovery HR Score mean?</title>

<p>
    A Recovery HR Score is very similar to a VO2max.  It is a common measure of the maximum amount of oxygen you can use during excercise.  This score is a measure of your aerobic endurance that we calculate from your heart rate after exercise, your age, and your gender.

<p>
    This type of testing has been done in a large number of people. So you can compare your score to a validated table of results and interpretations below:

    Your Recovery HR is usually stable over time because your heart and lungs donâ€™t change rapidly.  However, you can change your Recovery HR Score over weeks or months by doing things like losing weight, exercising, or quitting smoking.
